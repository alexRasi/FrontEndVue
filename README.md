# Online Text Editor

An online text editor, started as a training project in our summer internship at Enartia, Papaki,
with the basic goal to get familiar with the fundamentals of Vue.js using the ES6 version of Javascript.

Our main vision was to develop an editor which could recognize and send to a server every minimum recognizable
text modification instantly so no save is being required. After that, we intended to developing a version
having more than 1 users simultaneously on a shared document. For other internship purposes we paused its development.

Currently the editor can recognize every basic minimum text modifiction, and send it to a server.
Minimum text modifications include:
insert char at every position,
delete char at every position,
paste text,
cut,
select text and modify etc.
