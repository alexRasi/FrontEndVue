# Online Text Editor

An online text editor, started as a training project in our summer internship at Enartia, Papaki, with the basic goal to get familiar with the fundamentals of Vue.js using the ES6 version of Javascript.

Our main vision was to develop an editor which could recognize and send to a server every minimum recognizable text modification instantly so no save is being required. After that, we planned to develop a version having more than 1 users simultaneously on a shared document. For other internship purposes, we had to pause its development.

Currently, the editor can recognize almost every basic minimum text modification, and send it to a server. Minimum text modifications include: insert char at every position, delete char at every position, paste text, cut, select text and modify, etc.
